# Grow 1.0.0 Migration Guide

The `1.0.0` release for Grow marks the switch from Python 2.7 to Python 3.
This migration guide highlights some of the changes that the switch brings and
required changes to be able to use the latest grow.

## Python 3

The single biggest change is Grow is now only supporting Python 3.7+. In order
to use the latest Grow make sure that you have
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

You can test if you have Python 3 installed by running `python3 --version` in
the terminal.

## Grow packaged app -> Pipenv

On previous versions of Grow we offered a 'packaged' version of Grow as a
downloadable binary. With the change to Python 3 we have replaced the packaged
version of Grow with the usage of [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/). This change
allows for individual projects to easily run different versions of Grow and
provides a consistent way to install and update Grow.

Please follow the Pipenv [instructions for installing Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/#install-pipenv-today).

You can test if you have Pipenv installed by running `pipenv --version`

Once you have Pipenv installed, you can create the Pipenv configuration by
running the following in your project directory:

```bash
# Create a Pipenv environment using python 3 and install Grow.
pipenv --three
pipenv install grow
```

Pipenv will create a `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` that contain the configuration
for Pipenv. These files should be added to your repository.

After the initial `Pipfile` is added to the repository, update the readme and/or
other documentation to show updated instructions for installing and using Grow.

```bash
# Setup pipenv environment and install dependencies.
pipenv install
```

After the Pipenv installation is complete you can run grow commands:

```bash
# Run grow commands.
pipenv run grow install
pipenv run grow build
pipenv run grow run
# Etc...
```

*Tip:* If you are only using Grow on projects that use Grow >=1.0.0 you can add
a `grow` alias to your sh profile to shorten the command:
`alias grow=pipenv run grow`.

## Breaking changes

### Dropped support for old style formatting

Previously deprecated, the support for using old style python formatting in
`gettext()`, `_()`, and translations is removed. Instead use the [newer python
format style](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format).

For example:

```python
Hey %(name)s
```

becomes

```python
Hey {name}
```

### Extension Python 3 changes

Extensions may break when using Python 3. Please check that you are using the
latest versions of the extension in the `extensions.txt` file and update any
custom extensions to support Python 3.

You can try using the [`2to3` conversion
utility](https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html) to convert old extensions
over to Python 3.

If you have questions on converting extensions over to Python 3 you can ask for
help on the [Grow Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/growsdk).

### Docker image updates.

Previous versions of Grow were pinned to use Node 8 which is currently past the
end-of-life.

From `1.0.0` onwards the
[`grow/base` docker images](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/grow/base)
will use the [LTS version of Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).
This can cause issues as node dependencies will need to be updated to support
whatever the current LTS version of node is.

LTS versions of Node update about once a year around April according to the
current node [release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).

## Deprecations

### Legacy extensions

There is a relatively new way to [create extensions]([url('/content/docs/extensions/create.md')]).
Extensions using the older extension format will still be supported, but in the
long term extensions should be converted to use the new format as support for
older extensions will be dropped in the future.

When running Grow 1.0.0+ you may see a message similar to this:

```bash
Legacy preprocessors are deprecated and will be removed in the future: google_sheets
```

Please check with the individual extensions to see if they have an open issue
for converting over to the newer extension format.

For example, The `google-cloud-images` extension has an [issue open to track the
conversion to the newer extension style](https://github.com/grow/grow-ext-google-cloud-images/issues/13).

If you have questions on converting extensions over to the newer style you can
ask for help on the [Grow Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/growsdk).
