# A declarative, file-based static website generator

Grow.dev is a static site generator optimized for building highly-interactive,
localized microsites. Grow.dev focuses on providing optimal workflows and
developer ergonomics for creating projects that are highly maintainable in the
long-term.

Grow.dev encourages a strong-but-simple separation of content and presentation,
and makes maintaining content in different locales and environments a snap.

## Key features

- YAML-based content management with locale and environment variations
- Custom YAML types representing documents, data files, strings, etc.
- [Jinja templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/)
- Localization inbuilt (for content, translations, and URLs)
- Build sharding for massive websites
- Extensions and integrations with content sources
- No opinion about the client-side frontend stack

## Install

- [Read installation instructions](/install/)
- [Clone and run our starter project on GitHub](https://github.com/grow/starter)

## Learn

Grow.dev prefers configuration over code for defining a web site's content and
architecture. We keep Grow.dev simple so that you can learn about all its
capabilities within an hour or less.
