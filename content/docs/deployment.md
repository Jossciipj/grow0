# Launch destinations

Pods can be deployed in two ways: static and dynamic. For static deployment, a pod is built and the resulting fileset is deployed to the launch destination. For dynamic deployment, a pod is launched to a Grow PodServer, which then serves the pod up dynamically. Dynamic deployment is not yet available in the current version of Grow.

Grow can launch to the following destinations:

- Amazon S3
- Google Cloud Storage
- Local filesystem
