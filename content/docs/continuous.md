# Continuous integration

[TOC]

You can easily test, build, and/or deploy your website using a continuous integration (CI) system. CI systems remove extra steps from your project's lifecycle and allow you to save time on repetitive tasks.

## Using Travis CI for automatic deploys

The combination of GitHub, Travis CI, Grow SDK, and a static hosting service such as Google Cloud Storage or Amazon S3 allow you and your team to collaborate on Git and keep your site automatically up to date â€“ without ever having to run a deploy command.

In fact, this is [exactly how this documentation is deployed](https://github.com/grow/growsdk.org).

1. Set up your deployment (both the host and the configuration in `podspec.yaml`).
1. Connect your GitHub repo with Travis CI.
1. Configure Travis CI.

To configure Travis CI, add a `.travis.yml` file in your repository's root.
