# Developer's guide

You've reached the developer's guide for the Grow open source project. This guide is intended to teach you the technical aspects of building web sites using Grow and to provide you with a constant, living reference to the current version of the system.

After going through this guide, you'll be able to use Grow to build a website, manage and structure your content, internationalize your web site, and deploy it to the web.

Note that there are several ways to use Grow, and you don't have to be a developer to jump into the system. Grow is neither "cloud" nor "local" and you can either use your favorite local tools or a web interface to work on Grow sites. If you are not a developer, you may want to jump into the <a href="#">GrowEdit Guide</a>.
