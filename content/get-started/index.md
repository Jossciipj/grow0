# Get started with Grow

Getting started with Grow is pretty easy. You can download the GDK (the Grow Developer's Kit), initialize a site with a premade theme, and launch within minutes. Grow is designed to be something that you can fully learn within an hour.

The best way to get started with Grow is to dive into the [Try Grow](t) tutorial, which has been written to provide an introduction to Grow's basic capabilites.

You can explore the rest of the tutorials here to acquire a deeper understanding of Grow's various capabilities and how to use the system. Once you've come to grips with the system, navigate over to the [Docs](t) section of this site for reference and API documentation.
