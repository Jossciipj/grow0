## Usage

The Grow SDK is a command line tool you can invoke using the `grow` command. You can create a project and deploy it in just a few seconds. An end-to-end workflow (minus all the actual development work, of course) would look like the following.

    # Initialize a Grow project with the "cards" theme to the directory "~/example.com".
    grow init cards ~/example.com

    # Run a live development server.
    grow run ~/example.com

    # Build, test, and deploy the project to the default destination.
    grow deploy ~/example.com

But now, we're getting ahead of ourselves! Let's actually walk through each of these steps in order to learn more about the structure of Grow projects and what each command actually does.
