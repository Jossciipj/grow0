Let's take the concept of "configuration, not code" further. In this next step, we'll illustrate the ability to modify your site's content, and have those changes reflect globally across all pages in your site. These changes will illustrate the following abilities:

- automatically generated menus,
- specifying multiple titles for a document (e.g. a page title and a menu title),
- changing URLs and having those changes be reflected universally.

"Separation of content and presentation" is a foundational best practice in web content management. Grow maintains this best practice by allowing you to store all of your content (and structure) in configuration files in the `/content/` directory of your pod, and *not* mixed up with your HTML in `/views/`.

## Content anatomy

Here's the anatomy of a pod's file-based content management.

Path | What | Description
-- | -- | --
`/content/` | Content directory | Holds all content collections.
`/content/<collection>/` | Content collection | Holds all files within a single collection.
`/content/<collection>/_blueprint.yaml` | Blueprint | Defines configuration for a collection of content, including things like: URL path format, content structure, and view.
`/content/<collection>/<document>.md` | Document | Holds a single content document (including all field values, a Markdown body, and any blueprint overrides).

Collections and documents are identified in configs and templates by their file paths within a pod, so you should generally avoid changing the file paths of content files.

## Changing content and properties

Now we'll go through an exercise where we change a piece of content and some of its properties.Let's open up the file `/content/pages/team.md`. Here's what it looks like (with comments explaining each line).

    ---                        # Beginning of YAML front matter.
    $title: Team               # The document title.
    $view: /views/team.html    # The view used for this document (overrides blueprint).
    people:                    # Custom field names and values.

## How it works

To build your web site, Grow looks through all of the pod's collections and documents. From each piece of content's configuration, Grow derives both the URL to serve the page at and the template used to render the page. Again, no code determines URLs or templates – just configs – which means you can manage the entire architecture of your site by changing your site configs.

## URL customization

The ability to easily change URLs (both during and after the development phase of projects) is an important feature and also an important example of the "configuration, not code" philosophy. URLs are defined by a mix of definitions in `podspec.yaml`, a collection's `_blueprint.yaml`, and each individual content document.

In this example, we'll change the URLs for all content in the *pages* collection. Open `/content/pages/_blueprint.yaml` and change the highlighted line.

    title: Pages
    path: /site/pages/{basename}/
    view: /views/pages.html

Now, immediately everywhere, all content documents in the *pages* collection who inherit `path` from the blueprint will have their URL paths updated to the new format. This is true everywhere the document URLs are referenced: in automatically generated menus, in links, in the built fileset, etc.

Let's say you want to override the URL path format for one single page within the *pages* collection. Because documents *inherit* fields from their blueprint, you can do this easily by specifying the *$path* field in a document's YAML front matter.

Why is it prefixed with `$`? Field names prefixed with `$` in YAML front matter are *built-in fields*. All fields that do not have a `$` are custom, user-defined fields.

## Changing templates

Just like URL path formats, documents inherit templates from their blueprint too. If you have five pages in a "pages" collection, but need to override the template for just one of the pages, you can do that by specifying the *$view* field in the document's config.
