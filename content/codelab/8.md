That's the Grow SDK in about ten minutes. To get a better grip of the system, we recommend you to poke around changing configs, customizing templates, adding and removing content all within the *codelab* pod that you downloaded to your computer.

Once you're comfortable with how the different pieces of pods fit together – and your ability to customize and config each piece – you should be able to start using Grow to rapidly build and architect a web site from scratch!

Grow comes with a few pod themes built-in that can help you get started with site architecture really quickly. You can try any of the following commands:

    grow init blank ~/grow-blog/       # Just plain config scaffolding.
    grow init blog ~/grow-blog/        # A good old blog.
    grow init landing ~/grow-blog/     # A landing page for your organization.

This tutorial doesn't cover some of the more advanced features of Grow such as internationalization. Make sure to check out the rest of the documentation, including the samples, the reference material, and the template API to learn more about the rest of the capabilities.
