Building your site is the process of taking your pod (the input) and generating static files (the output). To do this, Grow analyzes all of the config files (primarily `podspec.yaml` and `content` configs), and produces a list of resources to export, and then exports them.

The `grow build` command will build your site and dump the generated output to a directory on your computer. Let's give it a try. The following command will build your site and dump the files to the default build location (a directory in your pod, `~/example.com/.grow/build/`).

    grow build ~/example.com/

To export files to a custom location, you can add the destination to the command.

    grow build ~/example.com/ ~/example.com-build/
