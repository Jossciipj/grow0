Welcome to Grow! Thanks so much for checking out this project – we think you're really going to like using Grow to build, manage, and launch your high-quality web sites. This codelab is intended to walk developers through the basics of Grow in just about *10 minutes*. Hopefully you'll learn what makes Grow so cool.

First of all, what do we mean by building *high-quality web sites*? To us, "high-quality" web sites are:

- optimized to be blazingly fast,
- well-suited for both desktop and mobile,
- secure,
- testable,
- easy to launch,
- easy to internationalize and to make available in many languages,
- easily maintainable for both developers and content owners,
- following web best practices (accessibility, architecture, etc.).

Grow was made to make all of this not just possible, but verifiable, so let's jump in right now.
