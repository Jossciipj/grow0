Launching your site is a lot like building, but Grow performs the heavy-lifting of figuring out exactly what has changed between the last launch and now, and presents you with a diff to confirm the launch before deployment. Grow can launch to a variety of destinations where you can host your web site (such as Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, GitHub Pages, Dropbox â€“ and you can even write a destination for your custom web server).

In this example, we'll just launch to the "local" destination, which launches your site build to a local directory on your machine.

This command deploys to a destination named "local", which is configured in `podspec.yaml`.

    grow deploy local ~/example.com/

The "local" destination has no notion of deploying redirects, so no redirects are configured, but it does write a custom 404 page.

Now let's change the URLs of our pages and run the deployment command once more. By doing this, you'll be able to see a diff when running `grow deploy`.

Open `/content/pages/_blueprint.yaml` and change the highlighted line:

    title: Pages
    path: /pages/{basename}/
    view: /views/pages.html

Now, run the deploy command again:

    grow deploy local ~/example.com/

And now, you can observe the diff upon deployment!
