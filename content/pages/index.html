    content: Flexible localization is easy and comes included. You can configure localized URL formats, easily specify what content is translated and what isn't, localize your content, and integrate with translation providers to translate your projects.

        Focus on what matters (your web sites!) when using Grow. Your projects are stored and managed entirely separate from the app, so you'll never have to maintain a deployed installation or deal with upgrades. Grow tests and verifies your sites upon each build.
