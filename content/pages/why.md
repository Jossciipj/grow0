### CEO

Your brand on the web is important. Modern web development is collaborative, rapid, and social. The tools and processes should within your organization should be liberating, not confining. Unhappy web teams produce bad web sites, which can impact your company's perception. **Grow's mission is to bring joy to building and launching web sites.**

With Grow, your web team will be happy and productive, which means you'll be able to do more with less – and produce better, higher-quality web sites.

### Front end developer

- Grow sites are entirely file-based, so you can bring your own tools.
- The Grow SDK runs on your machine for local development, and in the cloud for collaboration, management, and review.
- The Grow SDK has a full Python API – allowing your existing tools to easily interoperate.
- Grow projects are backed by Git for synchronization and workflow.

### Security engineer

- Security vulnerabilities are limited with Grow because the SDK does not sit in your codebase nor in your production serving path.
- Bring your own web server: Grow can export static files to your web server, or it can optionally autoconfigure CDNs such as Google Cloud Storage and Amazon S3 for web site serving.
- As part of the launch process, Grow can perform common security checks for static content. For example, you can enforce a content security policy to limit XSS vulnerabilities.

### Marketing manager

- Grow is the "launch button" for your web sites. It gives you an overview of the status of all your launches and allows you to precisely time web site launches in conjunction with things like product announcements and PR.
- Grow allows you to easily work with creative agencies. All an agency needs to do is download the Grow SDK to get started.
- Grow provides marketers with an easy, beautiful way to edit and propose content changes.

### Localization manager

- Grow has been designed with internationalization in mind. i18n is not a plugin.
- Grow supports content and string translation and region-specific content.

### Content author

- Grow implements a "content-first" approach that promotes the separation of content and presentation.
- You can architect the structure of your content and the content itself without thinking about HTML.
- Grow allows you to easily work with front end developers. Architect your content first, then send it over to the developer for her to make a page.
