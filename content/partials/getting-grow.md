There are two ways to install the Grow SDK. If you're unsure, stick with the Mac app. Regardless of how you get Grow, you run it using the command line command `grow`.

### Mac OS X app

You can download the Grow SDK as an OS X application. The entire SDK is packaged into the app, which just installs command line symlinks.

### Python egg

Alternatively, the Grow SDK is a Python program, so you can run it practically anywhere you can run Python. You can install Grow with [pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip).

    # Installs Grow in Python's site-packages directory.
    sudo pip install grow

    # Or, install Grow for a single user.
    pip install --user grow

The source code for the Python egg and the Mac app is all open source and [you can view it on GitHub](https://github.com/grow).
